    both collections of covered adjacent cells with some given information. 
    We can also see that the possible configurations of mines within the 
    groups are independent of one another, i.e. if there was a mine in the
    first frontier, perhaps at C, then this would tell us nothing about the 
    possible configurations of mines in the second frontier. Due to this reason,
    we split our rules into frontiers, as we can vastly reduce redundant 
    computation by not taking these independent frontiers into account. Let X 
    be the time it takes to permute through the first frontier, and let Y be the
